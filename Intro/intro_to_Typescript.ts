console.log("hello world")

let user = {
    name:"jayakumar",
    age:23
}

console.log(user.name);


// how to assign the type 
let myname: string = "hello Jk"

// typescript is does not camelcase and it's better to use variable names in lowercase
let mynum = 25


// if an error occurs an you need it to stop use export{}
export{}
